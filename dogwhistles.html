            <h1 id="bt3">Why Language Sucks.</h1>
            <h1 id="bt7"><a id="bt6">One day you know something and the next day it becomes entirely different:</a> <br><br>
                We are removing the terms Starseed and Indigo Children (effective immediately) and it only means more change for
                better outcomes.<br><br>
                <a id="bt8">
                    Language sucks, as speaks the title, and it really is quite horrible: I included the terms starseed in our
                    documentation cause of the word building of being not from earth yet, as it would seem, certain unsavoury communities
                     (nazis) are pursue-ant in making it seem they are in fact "chosen ones", they are stuck in a dark space surrounded
                      by a need to be better than others: it's concerning however they also appropriate that which they both oppress and
                      not + refuse to understand, it's not only concerning but also outright sickening and disgraceful that this occurs time and time again: 
                      it's why we at Lontence will be changing our communication
                      methods from now and into the future.<br><br>

                      This incident has inspired change. Coming soon, as with all things lontence, will be our Language Policy, it
                      will have in place just how we use language and how we combat dogwhistles from landing in a supportive letter or
                      mention. <br><br>

                      I'm sorry for using these terms and letting youse down, we intend to acknowledge,
                      we intend to recognise and not to ever be a spreader of hate.
                      <br><br>

                      Yours Sincerely,<br>
                      Exis Collective<br>
                      Chief Executives of Lontence.
