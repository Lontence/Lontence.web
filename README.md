## About Lontence
Lontence is an organisation focused on deliving better outcomes for all entities in this universe and beyond.

## Why Open Source?
In our operations we believe in transparency and accountability: we share the code of public Lontence projects for this reason so now you
can vet and even learn yourself from what we do and create for all.

## Public Lontence Projects?
Lontence has projects that we do not share with the public, this is typically due to such being used internally, we don't share our internal
code for the reason of keeping Lontence software/hardware/etc secure.

## What we Used
- VSCodium (coding)
- Inkscape (graphics and concept work)
- Google Fonts (fonts)
- Cloudflare (hosting and domain registrar)
- Firefox (web testing)
