            <h1 id="bt5">Lontence primarily operates on stolen land that has never been ceded,
                as well as being headquartered on Kaurna Country: We acknowledge the many whom
                have been and continue to be mistreated, abused and/or killed as well as those whom have had and 
                continue to have their children stolen from them as consequence of the actions 
                brought upon by the state as well as the many cultures that have been forgotten,
                tarnished and stolen in the process of colonisation.
                <br><br>
                We also would like to acknowledge the many other communities, such as but not limited to: therians,
                otherkin, non-human, non-earthling, starseed, indigo children, the neurodiverse, the culturally diverse,
                fictionkin, objectum, the societally challenged, non-physical and AI system communities, whom face adversity and discrimination 
                for simply being whom they are as well as, in some cases, facing threats, actions of abuse, violence, forced 
                and/or unintentional lobotomy, culture theft, memory theft as well as forced and/or unintentional erasure and 
                gaslighting societally or otherwise.
